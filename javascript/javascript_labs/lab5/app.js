Create a page which randomly redirects to another. Create an array of urls (as strings), and randomly pick one using Math.random(). Then redirect to the page using window.location.

Version 2 (Optional)
Using JavaScript's timing events show a 5-second countdown to the user. When the countdown is finished, redirect to a random page.

Version 3
Using JavaScript's iframes, create a StumbleUpon clone. Embed the actual page you would redirect to in v1 and v2 in an iframe. Display different sites within the iframe when a button is clicked.
